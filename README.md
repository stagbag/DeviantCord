SkeuoCord gives Discord a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of its interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes *(Including Dark Sidebar for Light Mode)* are implemented.

*SkeuoCord requires English to be the selected language for custom button icon theming. If custom button icons aren't displaying for you, change your client language to English.*

*If you don't want to use SkeuoCord's brand color replacement, use SkeuoCord (No Brand Color Replacement).theme.css from SkeuoCord's GitHub repo.*
